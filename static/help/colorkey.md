The values in :hub are shown alongside a color-coding, bar-filling system as follows:

- :aggregation[]{method="direct"} direct (full)
- :aggregation[]{method="descendant"} descendant (near full)
- :aggregation[]{method="ancestor"} ancestral (quarter full)

The color- and filling- bar system indicates which results are based on :span[direct]{.direct} measurements (full bars), which are inferred from :span[descendant]{.descendant} taxa (indicated by bars with an intermediate fill level), and which are inferred from sibling taxa via a shared :span[ancestor]{.ancestor} (indicated by mostly empty bars). For this last category, tooltips provide details of the common ancestral rank to provide an indication of how reliable the estimate may be, e.g. :tooltip[:span[ancestor]{.ancestor}]{title="family" arrow placement="right"}.
